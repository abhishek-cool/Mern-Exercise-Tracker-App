# Mern-Exercise-Tracker-App
 exercise tracker app using MERN stack.

1. Few development dependencies are missing from backend and frontend package.json files like - Nodemon, axios, bootstrap, etc.
2. Set-up MongoDB either on local server or use MongoDB Atlas
3. In the code, I have used MongoDB Atlas
4. Go to backend--> .env file
5. ATLAS_uri = enter your mongoDb Atlas connection string(you can get this by selecting option 'connect to your application' in mongodb Atlas) with password and database name.
6. Run the backend server separately, in terminal type - nodemon server.js
7. Run the frontend server separately, in terminal type - npm start 
8. Now njoy..!
